Rock, Paper, Scissors game

Previous version of this game was entirely console based. This version has a simple UI which let's the user play using on-screen buttons.
The match goes for 5 rounds. The user can either choose one of the moves, or reset the score and start over.

This project helped me get a little more comfortable manipulating DOM elements.
